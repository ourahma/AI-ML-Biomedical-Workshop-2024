# Machine Learning Workshop

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Description

This repository contains the code and resources for a practical **Machine Learning** workshop covering several supervised algorithms applied to different datasets. The goal is to become familiar with common methods and understand their practical implementation.

## ðŸ“Š Algorithms and Datasets

### 1. XGBoost - Classification on EMDHCTriadFC10Per.csv

* **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier
* **Dataset**: [EMDHCTriadFC10Per.csv](https://github.com/alicerueda/DDK-EMD-Feature-Extraction/raw/master/EMD%20Features/EMDDeltaEMD/EMDHCTriadFC10Per.csv)
* **Objective**: Build a high-performance classification model using features extracted via the EMD method.

### 2. KNN - Diabetes Classification

* **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* **Dataset**: [Diabetes Classification.xlsx](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/X4i8vXLw81g4wEH473zIFA/Diabetes-Classification.xlsx)
* **Objective**: Predict whether a patient is diabetic based on their medical data.

### 3. Poisonous Mushroom Classification

* **Algorithm**: Supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
* **Dataset**: [mushroom-cleaned.csv](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/3qPv1_g8n6KvWjyLOrjXyw/mushroom-cleaned.csv)
* **Objective**: Determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics.

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

* Understanding the training and evaluation pipeline of models.
* Comparing the performance of different algorithms on their respective datasets.
* Interpreting performance metrics.
